Each of these Paragraph objects contains a list of one or more Run objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text in a Word document is more than just a string. It has font, size, color, and other styling information associated with it. A style in Word is a collection of these attributes. A Run object is a contiguous run of text with the same style. A new Run object is needed whenever the text style changes.\n",
